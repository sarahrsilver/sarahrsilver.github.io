The site is just a quarto document. And you can put anything on it that could be in a quarto document.\nThere are also settings to get a list of site items you may want people to have easy access to. For example, a list of your blog posts, projects, etc.\nThere are different styles of landing pages. In this particular style, the index.qmd page is used as an about page. Instead of immediately showcasing your work, it showcases you! You can introduce yourself and include your contact information right by your image and description.\nYou can then also decide to have some content show up below the about portion as well."

The quarto document for a post will be named “index.qmd” insides of folder with the name of the post. For example, if I wanted my post to be titled “Demo Post 1” then I would do the following.\nAfter doing that, you can then edit the index.qmd document for that new post to your heart’s content. Lets do a little of that now so you can see how this might work."
